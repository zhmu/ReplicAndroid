# ReplicAndroid #

This is a QT6-based Windows application intended to make backups of your Android-based MTP device.

## Building ##

You'll need Visual Studio 2019 and QT 6 installed - I've been using QT 6.2.2. Open the `ReplicAndroid.sln` file and build the _Debug/x64_ or _Release/x64_ configurations and you should be good to go.
